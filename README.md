# Network Architecture Comparison Experiment
To ensure model detection accuracy while further improving detection efficiency and achieving a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and speed, we initially selected three neural network architectures, FasterNet, MobileViT, and EfficientViT, to be integrated separately with YOLO v5s and to compare their performance in weed recognition. The experimental results indicate that the FasterNet architecture demon-strated superior performance in weed recognition, effectively reducing memory con-sumption and enhancing detection speed.
In this section, in order to improve the computational efficiency and performance of the model, three efficient neural networks, FasterNet, MobileViT and EfficientViT, were selected for comparison and analysis to verify their effectiveness in terms of weed detection accuracy and efficiency. The detection results obtained on the dataset are shown in Table 3.

In the complex farmland environment of straw mulching and returning, it is nec-essary to reduce the model complexity and improve the model detection speed to real-ize real-time and accurate detection on the basis of ensuring the detection accuracy. The experimental results show that among the three network architectures, FasterNet, MobileViT and EfficientViT, the accuracy, recall and mAP values and detection speed of FasterNet are 90.3%, 87.5%, 92.3% and 74.6 f/s, respectively. The detection accuracy and detection speed are higher than the other two network architectures. Although FasterNet has the largest model memory of 6.34 MB, it is relatively small and can be effectively deployed on mobile devices. Therefore, we chose the FasterNet architecture to synergize with the YOLO v5s model to further improve the effectiveness of weed detection accuracy and detection efficiency.
